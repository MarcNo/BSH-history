# Sarah Wells

* The first colonial woman to settle on the Wawayanda Patent in May 1712
* She  was born in 1696 and some circumstantial evidence points to her early childhood in Piscataway, NJ, before moving to NYC with her parents.
* An indentured apprentice bound by public authority as a domestic handmaid to Manhattan carpenter and East River Dock Master Christopher Denne and his wife Elizabeth. Denne was an original owner, among 12, of the Wawayanda Patent in Orange County, NY
* At the age of 16, Sarah accepted Denne's offer to make his land claim in Orange County on the Otterkill when he promised her 100 acres when her indenture ended.
* She traveled by single-mast sloop from NYC up the Hudson River to Plum Point with 3 hired carpenters and 3 Munsee men as guides.
* They hiked 20 miles inland to the banks of the Otterkill in what became the township of Goshen and Sarah became the first colonial settling woman in the area.
* The Munsee men and the carpenters built Sarah a tree-branch wigwam on the creek and helped her get established before the Denne's arrived. 
* The Munsee taught the settlers how to plant crops, protect themselves against harm, and prepare for winter.
* In 1718, Sarah married William Bull on the 25th of August 1718.
* They had 12 children, five sons and seven daughters, born from 1721 to1745.
* Sarah worship in the German Lutheran Church and William was a congregant at the Church of England. 
* Their children were baptized by the German Lutheran ministers.
* William died in 1755/56, leaving Sarah at home with at least 5 minor children.
* Sarah married Johannes Miller, a German Lutheran settler in Montgomery, sometime between 1756 and 1770 but in 1770 left Johannes and returned to the Stone House, essentially divorced.
* Sarah's last church was the Blooming Grove Congregational Church, also known as a Presbyterian Church.
* She is buried  at Hamptonburgh Cemetery  just yards from the Stone House and next to her first husband William Bull.
* Sadly, Christopher Denne never gave her the 100 acres of promised land for her efforts to help settle Orange County. 
* In 1729, William and Sarah's and his first son John, 8 years old, bought 100 acres of land from Denne widow Elizabeth and the family has believed through lore that this was to get the promised land from the Denne estate. About half of that parcel are still owned by the Descendants. 
* 
* On April 23, 1796, the day of Sarah’s funeral, a family memorial was written listing her 12 children who bore 98 grandchildren, 212 great grandchildren and 13 great-great grandchildren, totaling 335 descendants
